### Hi there, I am Kristina ðŸ‘‹



- ðŸŽ“ I have a PhD in Applied Mathematics.
- ðŸŽ® I am a lifelong learner. I started liking programming when I was pursuing my PhD. It was during this period that I realized that I found the most intrigue in analyzing data and clustering algorithms. My latest interests revolve around multi-view learning, machine learning, pattern recognition and deep learning.
- Anyway, I am looking for a new position that is challenging, exciting and expanding. 

**Strong Languages:** Matlab **Currently learning:** Python/TensorFlow
