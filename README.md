### Hi there, I am Kristina ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸŽ“ I have a PhD in Applied Mathematics.
- ðŸŽ® I love everything about mathematics, statistics, data analysis, designing and executing solid research that addresses important scientific questions, and lifelong learning. I started liking programming when I was pursuing my PhD. It was during this period that I realized that I found the most intrigue in analyzing data and clustering algorithms. My latest interests revolve around clustering, unsupervised machine learning, pattern recognition and deep learning.
- Anyway, I am looking for a new position that is challenging, exciting and expanding.
